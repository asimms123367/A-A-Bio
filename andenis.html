		<h1>About Andenis</h1>
		<h2>My name</h2>
		<p>My name is Andenis Simms. My father played football and was an avid fan of the game so he gave me the name of two (2) Portuguese footballers. I am married and have one (1) child. My favourite sports teams are the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA and the Chelsea FC in the EPL. I also like cricket but usually T-20 but I will watch just about any sport.</p>

<h2>Home</h2>
<p> I am from Jamaica. It is a small English speaking island in the Caribbean. While we speak English, Patois is the language that is commonly spoken. Patois is a mixture of English, Spanish, French and Afriacn words spoken together. Jamaica is home to reggae icon, Bob Marley and the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt</p>
		
		<h2>Work</h2>

Additionally, I am a Justice of the Peace so i do a lot of civic duties and community work and development. As such, I work with a lot of young males where I do mentorship and program management. I find working with males to be rewarding by matching persons with mentors and especially with inner-city youths that need support. I am also the Founder of a Not for Profit organization that is gearred specifically fow working with males and youth development.</p>
